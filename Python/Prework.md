## SQL & Relational Databases

**Summary, from SQLBOLT.COM**
- SQL is a relational type of database that utilizes tables -- her job is tables.
- SELECT statements = queries
- Creating conditions for your requests makes it easier for the database to quickly return information because you are loading less of it.
- Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a primary key that identifies that entity uniquely across the database. Auto-incrementing integer, string, etc.
- Each database has its own supported set of mathematical, string, and date functions that can be used in a query, which you can find in their own respective docs.
- *SELECT col_expression AS expr_description, â€¦ FROM mytable;*
- The GROUP BY clause works by grouping rows that have the same value in the column specified.
- Apply WHERE so that the correct number of rows are updated, unless you want all rows to be changed.
- Use SELECT to make sure you are querying the correct data before deleting them, if you want to double check.
- Create schemas with the types of data.

## Command Line

**The Command Line** 
- bash -- which stands for Bourne again shell
- echo - shows your current shell
- arrow up to previous commands

**Basic Navigation** 
- pwd- print working directory
- ls - shows what's in our current directory
- ls -l long listing about the files in directory
- ls /etc list the directory's contents
- root / - top of the directory
- absolute path -> begin with / in relation to root directory
- relative path -> specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system, does not begin with /
- ~ a shortcut for your home directory
- . reference to your current directory
- ../../ go up two directories, .. up a directory
- cd / == cd ~/Documents == cd ../../
- cd sends you back to your home directory without any arguments

  **More About Files**
  - Linux is case sensitive
  - handle files with spaces --> cd 'Holiday Photos'
  - ls -a list the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
  
  **Manual Pages**
  - man <command> - Look up the manual page for a particular command.
- man -k <search term> -Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
- /<term> -Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
- n -After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.

 **File Manipulation**
- mkdir + name -- make directory
- rmdir [options] <Directory> - remove directory
-  -p which tells mkdir to make parent directories as needed (demonstration of what that actually means below). The second one is -v which makes mkdir tell us what it is doing 
- touch -- make blank files
- cp [options] <source> <destination> -- copy
- mv [options] <source> <destination> -- move
- rm [options] <file> -- cannot be undone, but removes or deletes files
- -r When rm is run with the -r option it allows us to remove directories and all files and directories contained within. -i with -r will make it interactive so you know which files you are removing with prompts first.
