It can be reused over so we don't have to type over a million of the same things.
Easily replaced.
Can be used in multiple contexts.
Can be extended, using EXTENDS... in React.
Doesn't expose the inner bits of the code to the user.
Independent of other components. 

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
Easy to deploy new things without affecting the whole app.
Costs less to use things that already exist.
It's easier to use libaries of other code to create something. 
Easy to resuse components. 
Each component working on its own increases the reliability of the whole structure. 
Easy to update and maintain. 
Independent and flexible. 


**What is “props” short for?**
"Properties" being used for passing data from one component to another.
**How are props used in React?**
Props are passed into components like function arguments
Props data is immutable (read-only)
**What is the flow of props?**
